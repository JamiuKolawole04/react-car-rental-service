    desc2: "First things first, you need to make sure that you are comfortable behind the wheel of the car you plan to drive. Therefore, once you are in the driving seat, adjust it as per your height and comfort. Next, adjust the mirrors, both the inside unit and the ones on the outside. Being comfortably seated would help you keep your calm when you start driving for the first time.Also, make sure you don’t overthink about the situation.Driving is an experience that requires multi- tasking as your brain needs to analyse a lot that’s going on around you.There are some basic rules that you must follow.While it is highly important to use turn indicators and to understand the road signs, it’s of even higher importance to make sure your mind is not pre - occupied, which might, in turn, hamper your focus on the road.It’s natural to feel a bit nervous when driving for the first time.Therefore, it will be a good idea to have an experienced driver in the co - driver seat to help you with some basic guidance where and when required.There is a reason that it’s compulsory to have a learned driver in the co - driver seat when you start driving on a learner’s license.He can go on to help you make minor corrections in your driving.

This is why flat car batteries are the number one reason for call-outs to breakdown services.There are a number of reasons why car batteries die.A few common ones include:Leaving headlights, interior lights, flashers, and the radio on when the car isn't running, Using the air conditioner when the car is not running Not starting a car for long periods of time(e.g., while it's in storage), Lack of battery maintenance(e.g., not keeping terminals clean), Failure of the diode bridge or voltage regulator in the alternator; the alternator charges the battery when the car is running, Low air temperature, which causes batteries to freeze. What To Do When Your Car Battery Dies.",

    desc2: "The most common way to deal with a dead battery is by jump-starting it. All you need to jump-start a car is a set of jumper cables and another car (a good Samaritan) with a functional battery. Keep in mind that you should never try to jump-start a car if its battery is cracked and is visibly leaking acid"

      " There’s really no better gift to give yourself or others than the gift of experiences and travel. Surprising someone with a trip can be the ultimate present … to give and receive. There’s just no question that a memorable travel experience is almost guaranteed to deliver more long-term happiness than another fuzzy sweater or gadget wrapped up in a bow.Personally, I’m a sucker for putting slightly over- the - top gifts under the tree from time to time — including surprise trips.The pandemic slowed down that type of gifting at my house, but this may be the year that is right to try it once again..",

    desc2: "Even in normal times, giving a trip as a surprise can be complicated, or even disastrous, if you aren’t careful. Here are my tried-and-tested tips for gifting a surprise trip to a close friend or family member. Be certain they’ll love it : If you can’t be 100% sure whether or not the gift recipient will love the trip’s itinerary and be available to travel on the scheduled dates (with an appropriate passport, COVID-19 requirements, etc.), you shouldn’t book the trip as a surprise.You can still surprise them with the idea of the trip, but don’t make the actual bookings(or at least any nonrefundable reservations) until you know for sure they want to go and are available"
